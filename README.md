# Django Chat Project

This is a Django-based chat application with basic user authentication functionality. The application allows users to register, log in, log out, and access a chat room after logging in and that allows users to chat in real-time using WebSockets. It uses Django Channels for WebSocket support and Redis as the message broker.

## Features
- **User Registration**: Users can create a new account using the `UserCreationForm` from Django's built-in authentication system.
- **User Login**: Users can log in using their username and password through the `AuthenticationForm`.
- **User Logout**: Users can log out from their session, which redirects them to the login page.
- **Chat Room**: Once logged in, users are redirected to a chat room page where they can interact with other logged-in users.
